# Responsive Landscape Layout

This update introduces CSS `@media (orientation: landscape)` rules to improve usability on devices that are wide but short. Navigation, controls and other interface elements adjust to better fit the available height.

Screenshots demonstrating the layout were captured on a landscape-oriented emulator and saved in `landscape-placeholder.txt`.
